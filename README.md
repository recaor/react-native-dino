# DINO GAME

## How to run the project?

- Please install npm packages
  `npm install`

- Run the project with this command line
  `npm start`

## Development details

- To build the `dino` game, we used `matter-js` and `react-native-game-engine`.
- Currently, there is no the suitable npm for the fast image process. So we just used `Image` from 'react-native`.
  We need to fix this problem soon.
